### Team 1 Database-design-project-1-2
### Kitchen Health Inspection database
#### This is the Database repository for Design project 1/2. 
#### This team consists of David, Ryan, Tijan, & Evalyn.
##### In This assignment there was two parts. Part one was to perform the following:
##### - Define the use case - select a database type
##### - Define the Stake Holders/Users
##### - Gather the requirements
##### - Define success criteria

##### Part two of this assignment consists of building up the data base, providing an EER diagram, & running test samples
Each person in this team picked a table to build and develop. After each team member developed a table, we came together to bring the tables together for a single database. Our database consisted of 4 core tables and 4 sub tables( 3 personnel sub tables & 1 Junction table) Foreign keys were added to the junction table to allow for which staff members are certified for which competencies, mapping ingredients to recipes, and linking inspection records to multiple kitchen areas or staff roles.
