## Team 1 Database-design-project-1-2
### Kitchen Health Inspection database 
### This team consists of David, Ryan, Tijan, & Evalyn.

#### In This assignment there was two parts. Part one was to perform the following:
##### - Define the use case - Selected a relational database per assignment to support normalized schemas & foreign key constraints.
##### - Define the Stake Holders/Users - users of this database would be kitchen staff, inspectors, Health department auditors.
##### - Gather the requirements - track staff compentency, inspection logs, recipe ingredients mapping
##### - Define success criteria - integrated teamwork, EER diagram, Test samples and Foreign key mapping.

#### Part two of this assignment consists of building up the data base, providing an EER diagram, & running test samples
Each person in this team picked a table to build and develop. After each team member developed a table, we came together to bring the tables together for a single database. Our database consisted of 4 core tables and 4 sub tables( 3 personnel sub tables & 1 Junction table) Foreign keys were added to the junction table to allow for which staff members are certified for which competencies, mapping ingredients to recipes, and linking inspection records to multiple kitchen areas or staff roles.
